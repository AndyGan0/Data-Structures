# Data-Structures
These are 2 projects created during my university course "DATA STRUCTURES"
Language: C++

<br><br>
#  Project 1
Implemented a custom linked lists structure in C++ and created multiple linked lists with random integers.
The output is a new linked list that contains all elements that appear in at least half of the previously created linked lists.
The output list is sorted.
<br>Optimizations were applied to make the program more efficiency.

<br><br>
#  Project 2
Implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST). Supported methods are: insert, delete and search
Deletion marks the nodes as deleted instead of removing them, if they have two children. <br>
When more than half of the nodes are marked as deleted, the entire tree is rebuilt. <br>
Additionally, if the balancing condtion is violated after an insertion, the tree is also rebuilt.
The project includes functions to find minimum and maximum values, elements within a range, as well as printing the tree.
