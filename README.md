# Data-Structures
These are 2 projects created during my university course "DATA STRUCTURES"
Language: C++

#  Project 1
Implemented a custom linked lists structure in C++ and created multiple linked lists with random integers.
The output is a new linked list that contains all elements that appear in at least half of the previously created linked lists.
The output list is sorted
Optimizations were applied to make the program more efficiency.
